				The quality(Generosity) of Trees
	</h1>
</center>
<p> Trees filter our air and keep it fresh by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.</p>

<p>Tree roots stabilize the soil and prevent erosion.</p>
 
<p>Trees improve water quality by slowing and filtering rain water as well as protect aquifers and watersheds.</p>
 
<p>Trees are carbon sinks, accumulating carbon as they grow and acting as stable carbon stores upon maturity</p>
 
<p>Three-quarters of the world's people rely on wood as their main source of energy.</p>
 
<p>Thousand of things are made from trees such as furniture, books, newspapers, houses, hockey sticks, guitars, pencils, fences, milk cartons, even nail polish and toothpaste.</p>
 
<p>Trees lower air temperature and induce rainfall by evaporating water from their leaves.</p>
 
<p>Trees provide food, shade and shelter to humans and wildlife.</p>
 
<p>Trees offer protection from the downward fall of rain, sleet and hail as well as reduce storm run-off and the possibility of flooding.</p>
 
<p>Trees act as sound barriers to reduce noise pollution.</p>
 
<p>Trees play a major role in helping to conserve the intensity of the Earth's magnetic field.</p>
 
<p>Trees beautify the landscape.</p>

	<h1>Facts about Trees</h1>
</center>

<h3>Oldest</h3>
<p>Found in the Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park in California, the oldest tree recognized is a Redwood known as Eternal God. The tree is believed to be 12,000 years old, although it is argued as being only 7,000 years old, which still makes it the oldest.</p>

<h3>Slowest</h3>
<p>A White Cedar located in the Great Lakes area of Canada, has only grown to less than 4 inches tall during its 155 years.</p>

<h3>Tallest</h3>
<p>In 1872, an Australian Eucalyptus at Watts River, Victoria in Australia was said to measure to 435 feet, but it is speculated that it probably measured to over 500 feet at some point in its life. The tallest living tree is a Coast Redwood known as the "Mendocino Tree" found in Montgomery State Reserve in California. This tree, which is over 1000 years old, is more than 367 feet and 6 inches tall and still growing.
</p>
<h3>Most Massive</h3>
<p>The "Lindsey Creek Tree", a Coast Redwood with a minimum trunk volume of 90,000 cubic feet and a minimum total mass of 3630 tons was the most massive known tree until it blew over in a storm in 1905. The most massive living tree is "General Sherman", a giant sequoia found in the Sequoia National Park in California. It is 275 feet tall with a girth of 102 feet and 8 inches.</p>

<h3>Deepest Roots</h3>
<p>A Wild Fig tree at Echo Caves, near Ohrigstad, Mpumalanga, South Africa has roots reaching 400 feet making it the deepest a treeâ€™s roots have penetrated.</p>

<h3>Fastest Growing</h3>
<p>In 1974, it was noted that an Albizzia falcata in Sabah, Malaysia had grown 35 feet and 3 inches in 13 months: an approximate of 1.1 inches per day.</p>

<h3>Greatest Girth</h3>
<p>In the late 18th century a European Chestnut known as the Tree of the Hundred Horses on Mount Etna in Sicily, in Italy had a circumference of 190 feet. It has since separated into three parts.</p>

<h3>Most Dangerous</h3>
<p>The Manchineel Tree of the Caribbean coast and the Florida Everglades is a species that secretes an exceptionally poisonous and acid sap. Upon contact to the skin, a break out of blisters would occur. In the occasions where there is contact to the eye, a person can be blinded, and a bite of its fruit causes blistering and severe pain. This tree has been feared ever since the Spanish explorers came to the Americas in the 16th century.</p>

<p>There are about 20,000 tree species in the world. India has one of the largest tree treasuries in the world followed by the US.</p>
 
<p>No tree dies of old age. They are generally killed by insects, disease or by people. California Bristlecone Pines and Giant Sequoias are regarded as the oldest trees and have been known to live 4,000 to 5,000 years.</p>
 
<p>Trees grow from the top, not from the bottom as is commonly believed.</p>
 
<p>Trees receive an estimated 90% of their nutrition from the atmosphere and only 10% from the soil.</p>
 
<p>About one-half the weight of dry wood is carbon.</p>
 
<p>In ancient Mesopotamia (now Iraq), the value of wood was equal to that of precious gemstones and metals.</p>
 
<p>Romeâ€™s monetary system was based on silver which required huge quantities of wood to convert ore into metal.</p>
 
<p>Dendrochronology is the science of calculating a tree's age by its rings.</p>
 
<p>Tree rings provide precise information about environmental events, including  volcanic eruptions.</p>

<h3>Trees help clean our air.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Global forests removed about about one-third of fossil fuel emissions annually from 1990 to 2007.</li>
<li>Trees remove pollution from the atmosphere, improving air quality and human health.</li>
<li>In Los Angeles, trees remove nearly 2,000 tons of air pollution each year.</li>
<li>In Chicago, trees remove more than 18,000 tons of air pollution each year.</li>
<li>In Greater Kansas City, trees remove 26,000 tons of air pollution each year.</li>
<li>Roadside trees reduce nearby indoor air pollution by more than 50 percent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trees contribute to our health.</h3>

<p>A study of 10 cities found community forests save an average of one life each year. In New York City, trees save an average of eight lives every year.</p>
<p>Office workers with a view of trees report significantly less stress and more satisfaction.</p>
<h3>Trees provide us with oxygen.</h3>
<ul>
<li>One large tree can provide a day's supply of oxygen for up to four people.</li>
<li>More than 20 percent of the world's oxygen is produced in the Amazon Rainforest.</li>
<h3>Trees help clean our drinking water.</h3>
<p>
Forested watersheds provide quality drinking water to more than 180 million Americans.</p>
<p>In 1997, New York City spent $1.5 billion to preserve the forested watershed that supplies New York City's drinking water by purchasing thousands of upstate acres of forested watershed. A filtration plant large enough to clean New York City's water supply would have cost more than $6 billion dollars.</p>
<p>Today, New Yorkers enjoy some of the cleanest drinking water in the world, and New York City has won regional water taste competitions.</p>
<h3>Trees provide much-needed cooling.</h3>

<p>Trees lower surface and air temperatures by providing shade. Shaded surfaces may be 20–45°F cooler than the peak temperatures of unshaded materials.
Trees cool the city by up to 10°F by shading our homes and streets and releasing water vapor into the air through their leaves.
Evaporation of water from trees has a cooling influence.
</p><h3>Trees help reduce the effects of climate change.</h3>
<p>
Trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO2), removing and storing the carbon while releasing the oxygen back into the air.
In one year, an acre of mature trees absorbs the amount of CO2 produced by a car driven 26,000 miles.
During one year, a mature tree will absorb more than 48 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen in exchange.
Nearly 20 pounds of carbon dioxide are produced from burning one gallon of non-ethanol gasoline.</p>
<h3>Trees help us save energy.</h3>

<p>Trees properly placed around buildings can reduce air conditioning needs by 30 percent and can save 20–50 percent in energy used for heating.
The average Cincinnati community tree saves the average household $56 annually in cooling costs by reducing electricity use. More than 85,000 Cincinnati community trees save residents $4.8 million.
Carefully positioned trees can reduce a household's energy consumption for heating and cooling by up to 25 percent. Computer models devised by the U.S. Department of Energy predict that the proper placement of only three trees can save an average household between $100 and $250 in energy costs annually.</p>
<h3>Trees benefit wildlife.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trees provide vital wildlife habitat.</li>
<li>In British Columbia, Canada, more than 80 wildlife species depend on trees.</li>
<li>Trees and forests provide important species range. Many animals have a range of hundreds of square miles. The mountain lion of North America, for instance, has a range of nearly 400 square miles.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Trees help reduce crime.

In Baltimore, a 10 percent increase in tree canopy corresponded to a 12 percent decrease in crime.
Among minor crimes, there is less graffiti, vandalism and littering in outdoor spaces with trees as a part of the natural landscape than in comparable plant-less spaces.
Chicago public housing residents with nearby trees and natural landscapes reported 25 percent fewer acts of domestic aggression and violence.
Trees are a good investment of our public dollars

Every dollar spent on planting and caring for a community tree yields benefits that are two to five times that investment—benefits that include cleaner air, lower energy costs, improved water quality and storm water control and increased property values.
In Indianapolis, each dollar invested in the city's community trees yielded $5.55 in benefits.
In New York City, it has been calculated that community trees provide $5.60 in benefits for every dollar spent on tree planting and care.
In Cincinnati, the return on a $1 investment in the city's community trees is $4.44.
The mature street trees in Beverly Hills, California, are worth $450 million.
A cost-benefit analysis of the Berkeley, California tree canopy indicated that each camphor tree had an annual net benefit to the city and its residents of nearly $12,500, each shamel ash showed a $9,600 annual net benefit, and each London planetree had an annual net benefit of more than $8,700 per tree.
Trees increase our property values.

In Portland, Oregon, homes with street trees sold for $7,130 more, on average, and 1.7 days more quickly.
Neighboring houses within 100 feet of street trees sold for $1,688 more, on average.
The sale premium of having street trees was the same as adding 129 square feet of finished space.
In Fulton County (Atlanta), Georgia, mature trees positively influenced home sale prices. Homes sold for nearly $105,000 more in neighborhoods with mature trees.
