	<h1>WATER</h1>
</center>
<p>
There is no other planet like Earth in our solar system: no other planet is both rocky and has flowing water at its surface. Without water, life as we know it could not exist. Although our planet is covered by seemingly vast oceans, only a small fraction of the water on Earth is fresh, and even less is readily accessible. As the population grows, it becomes more important to understand how to manage and protect our fresh water supply.

<p>
Water is very useful. It generates electricity and waters the grains, fruits and vegetables that people and animals eat. It can also be very dangerous, causing much destruction from flooding and landslides. Concern about the purity of both surface and groundwater is a growing issue. If we misuse chemicals on our crops, lawns, or industry both surface and groundwater supplies may be contaminated.

Some scientists study water in streams, rivers, and underground. They measure rain and snowfall, how much runs off into streams, [taking soil and water samples]and how much filters through the soil and rocks into the underground water system. These scientists work with biologists, chemists, public health specialists, physicists, geologists and atmospheric scientists, who also have a personal and professional concern about water. What do we call these scientists? Hydrologists

Some scientists study oceans. They investigate how biology, geology, meteorology, physics, and chemistry interact to shape the marine environment. They have discovered that the floor of Earth’s oceans has high mountains, deep valleys, shelves and slopes, and is as varied as the surface of the land. Some of these scientists study how tides and storms move sand to and from beaches. Because a large percentage of Earth’s population lives within 50 miles of a coast, understanding these processes is very important. They also investigate how the oceans move heat around our planet, and they work with meteorologists to predict changes in weather and climate. This team is now better able to predict and monitor El Niño and La Niña events, which are warm and cold ocean currents that have a big impact on weather. Ocean Submersible

<h3>Water covers 71% of the Earth.</h3>

Many scientists concentrate their attention on the chemical composition of ocean water. Most of the substances in seawater come from the land, where they have been dissolved and then carried by rivers to the oceans. Some of these substances are pesticides, herbicides, and other waste products from human activities. These scientists work with marine biologists to understand the impact that toxic chemicals are having on marine plants and animals. They use ships, deep submersibles, fixed platforms, underwater laboratories, aircraft, and Earth-orbiting satellites to learn about our environment. What do we call all these scientists? Oceanographers

<p> 1993, the United Nations General Assembly designated March 22 as the first World Water Day. And with good reason – without water, we’d be nothing. Just dust. Water is one of the most common substances on earth, and one of the most vital; it’s a tremendously valuable resource, yet one we squander and pollute prodigiously.</p>

<p>Water is deceptive. For while it pours freely from the heavens and seems to flow endlessly in rivers, it’s a finite resource; we only have what we have. And although there is about 332,500,000 cubic miles of it on earth – only one-hundredth of one percent of the world's water is readily available for human use. We really need to learn how to show it some respect. Which is where World Water Day comes in.</p>

<p>Even though water deserves celebration every day, we’ll take this occasion to give a shout-out to this incredible compound that gives us life and sustains the planet around us. So with that in mind, consider the following facts – some wondrous, some disconcerting, all eye-opening:</p>

<p>1. The average human body is made of 50 to 65 percent water.</p>

<p>2. Newborn babies have even more, ringing in at 78 percent water.</p>

<p>3. A gallon of water weighs 8.34 pounds; a cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 pounds.</p>

<p>4. A liter of water weighs 1 kilo; a cubic meter of water weighs 1 tonne. (The rest of the statistics are in imperial units since they are U.S.-based and so is this site; but the original metric system was created with base units that could be derived from the weight of a specified volume of pure water ... hence the nice round numbers.)</p>

<p>5. An inch of water covering one acre (27,154 gallons) weighs 113 tons.</p>

<p>6. Water covers 70.9 percent of the planet’s surface.</p>


<p>7. Ninety-seven percent of the water on Earth is salt water; the water found in the Earth’s lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, swamps, etcetera accounts for only 0.3 percent of the world’s fresh water. The rest is trapped in glaciers or is in the ground.</p>
<p>8. There is more water in the atmosphere than in all of our rivers combined.</p>

<p>9. If all of the water vapor in our planet’s atmosphere fell as water at once and spread out evenly, it would only cover the globe with about an inch of water.</p>

<p>10. More than one-quarter of all bottled water comes from a municipal water supply – the same place that tap water comes from.</p>

<p>11. Approximately 400 billion gallons of water are used in the United States per day; nearly half of that is used for thermoelectric power generation.</p>

<p>12. In a year, the average American residence uses over 100,000 gallons.</p>

<p>13. Since the average faucet releases 2 gallons of water per minute, you can save up to four gallons of water every morning by turning off the tap while you brush your teeth.</p>

<p>14. A running toilet can waste up to 200 gallons of water each day.</p>

<p>15. At one drip per second, a faucet can leak 3,000 gallons in a year.</p>

<p>16. A bath uses up to 70 gallons of water; a five-minute shower uses 10 to 25 gallons.</p>

<p>17. The first water pipes in the U.S. were made from hollowed logs.</p>
<p>18. Leaks in the New York City water supply system account for 36 million gallons of wasted water per day.</p>

<p>19. There are around one million miles of water pipeline and aqueducts in the U.S. and Canada, enough to circle the globe 40 times.</p>

<p>20. 748 million people in the world do not have access to an improved source of drinking water</p>

<p>21. And 2.5 billion people do not have use of an improved sanitation facility.</p>

<p>22. Some 1.8 billion people worldwide drink water that is contaminated with feces.</p>

<p>23. The World Health Organization recommends 2 gallons per person daily to meet the requirements of most people under most conditions; and around 5 gallons per person daily to cover basic hygiene and food hygiene needs.</p>

<p>24. On average, an American resident uses about 100 gallons of water per day.</p>

<p>25. On average, a European resident uses about 50 gallons of water per day.</p>

<p>26. On average, a resident of sub-Saharan Africa uses 2 to 5 gallons of water per day.</p>


<p>27. It takes .26 gallons of water to irrigate one calorie of food.</p>
<p>28. (Yet it takes 26 gallons for one calorie of food when water is used inefficiently.)</p>

<p>29. It takes 2.6 gallons of water to make a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>30. It takes 6.3 gallons of water to make 17 ounces of plastic.</p>

<p>31. It takes 924 gallons of water to produce 2.2 pounds of rice.</p>

<p>32. It takes 2,641 gallons of water to make a pair of jeans.</p>

<p>33. It takes 3,962 gallons of water to produce 2.2 pounds of beef.</p>

<p>34. It takes 39,090 gallons of water to manufacture a new car.</p>

<p>35. In developing nations women and girls are primarily responsible for collecting water; on average, 25 percent of their day is spent on this task.</p>

<p>36. Collectively, South African women and children walk a daily distance equivalent to 16 trips to the moon and back to fetch water.</p>
